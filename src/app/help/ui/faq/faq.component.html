        <mat-panel-title> How do I modify my transactions? </mat-panel-title>

      <p>
        It can be easily done through the transactions tab of the website. Open
        the tab, and you will see your past transactions. You can change the
        date range to see the transactions in a specific period. Click on any
        transaction to view, edit, or delete it.

        <mat-panel-title> What is the point of Coinkeeper? </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        In the ever-growing inflation era, it is very easy to not realize what
        and where you are spending your hard-earned money. Keeping track of your
        spending is extremely crucial in the current era. But most people do not
        know how they could do it? Traditional tools like account books,
        diaries, and excel may seem daunting and tedious. I agree that there are
        a lot of digital solutions, but they are again something which you have
        to learn how to use. My target while building this was to make it easy
        for everyone, since they should focus on earning and saving, and
        tracking should not be a hassle.

        <mat-panel-title> How secure is my data? </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        We never store passwords on our server. Transaction data is encrypted in
        transit, and all transactions in our database are stored in an encrypted
        format, the key to which is unique to each user and stored in a
        decentralized manner.
