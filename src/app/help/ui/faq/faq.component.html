        <mat-panel-title> Why do I need Coinkeeper? </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        In the ever-growing inflation era, it is very easy to not realize what
        and where you are spending your hard-earned money. Keeping track of your
        spending is extremely crucial in the current era. But most people do not
        know how they could do it? Traditional tools like account books,
        diaries, and excel may seem daunting and tedious. I agree that there are
        a lot of digital solutions, but they are again something which you have
        to learn how to use. My target while building this was to make it easy
        for everyone, since they should focus on earning and saving, and
        tracking should not be a hassle.

        <mat-panel-title> How secure is my data? </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        We never store passwords in our database, all the user data including transactions is encrypted in transit as well as in storage using AES-256 encryption.
